Automation Script Setting Up a Virtual Environment for TensorFlow, TensorFlow-Metal, and PyTorch for macbook user with  Apple sillicon chip 

TensorFlow, TensorFlow-Metal, and PyTorch are powerful deep learning frameworks widely used in various applications. To effectively manage these frameworks and their dependencies, it's recommended to work within a virtual environment. A virtual environment isolates the project's dependencies from the global Python environment, preventing conflicts and ensuring compatibility.

This article provides a step-by-step guide on creating a virtual environment and installing TensorFlow, TensorFlow-Metal, and PyTorch using a Python script. The script automates the process, making it easier to set up a consistent development environment for your deep learning projects.

#### Prerequisites
Before proceeding, ensure you have the following:

1.Python 3 installed

2.Pip installed (usually comes with Python)

3. A code editor or IDE to write and run the Python script
